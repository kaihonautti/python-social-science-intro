    "\n",
    "1. Functions are usuful tool to separate the task into sub-tasks you can easily manage.\n",
    "1. Functions allow you to separate some parts of the logic into a place where it can be changed easily (compared with: you had copypasted the same calculation routines of student's own income to several places in your program, and then the laws change)\n",
    "1. Sometimes they make the code cleaner and thus easier to work on later on."
